In this challenge i created a notification page

I mainly used Flexbox,HTML,CSS,Javascript to accomplish this project

my main motivation to do this challenge was learning how to write Javascript Code

I mostly struggled to add some notification points next to notification message but i solved that problem by simply adding notification point

to p:first-of-type's ::after pseudo element in javascript part i struggled with the notification counter but i solved this problem by using

For-each loops and accessing css classes with Javascript

Feel free to use my code
